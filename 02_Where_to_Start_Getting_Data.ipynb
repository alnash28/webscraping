If you right click on a page element and slect *Inspect Element*, a window will pop up that allows you to view the page source as it is rendered. The difference is that *View Page Source* shows you the page **before** any javascript is run and *Inspect Element* shows you the page **after** all javascript is run. \n",

However, for dynamically loaded pages such as the [infinite scroll version](http://quotes.toscrape.com/scroll), the two methods show different code. *Inspect Element* is often more useful, it is important to understand that the code you see can be different from the code that you'll get when you request the page.

    "When you are encoutering dynamically loaded content, your browser's developer's tools can help identify where to get the data. The developer's tools can usually be accessed by pressing <kbd>F12</kbd>. Go to the *Network* tab in the developers tools, clear the log, and ensure that it is set to capture activity. In Chrome, the bright red button indicates that it's ready to capture network traffic. Once you are set, perform an action that would trigger the data you are after (scroll the page, submit a form, etc.). In this example using the [infinite scroll interface](http://quotes.toscrape.com/scroll), you can see two page requests have been filled since the page was loaded. Looking closely, you can see the headers for the requests and preview the data returned by the server.\n",
